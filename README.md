# Portfolio Website

This contains the content of my [portfolio website](https://www.winterstein.biz), which is generated with [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) from the contents of this repository.
 If you also want to build a website based on the [project-portfolio](https://github.com/awinterstein/zola-theme-project-portfolio) theme, it's better use the [example project](https://github.com/awinterstein/zola-theme-project-portfolio-example) as a basis.
