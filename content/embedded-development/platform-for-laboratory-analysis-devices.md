A software platform was to be developed for the next generation of laboratory analysis instruments. On the basis of which the respective teams could develop the instrument functions. A service-oriented architecture was implemented on a Linux system, whereby the testability played an important role.

## Responsibilities
Co-development of the software platform. Focus on the integration with the build system and the guidance of junior colleagues at the customer regarding C++ programming and software design.
