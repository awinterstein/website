After goods have been transported, it should be possible to determine whether the cold chain has been maintained and the package has neither fallen down nor been tilted. For this purpose, a firmware was developed, which logs environmental values such as temperature and humidity on an SD card and can also detect and log shock and tilt events. A readout of the data was possible via Bluetooth LE. The system was based on a hardware platform and development environment created by the customer.

## Responsibilities
Firmware development with focus on energy efficiency. Clarification of requirements and guidance of junior colleagues.
