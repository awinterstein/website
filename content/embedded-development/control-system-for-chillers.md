The customer developed a compression refrigeration machine with
a new type of coolant for industrial use. The existing prototype of
an IPC-based device controller was to be replaced by a significantly
cheaper microcontroller solution.

## Responsibilities

Co-development of the firmware middleware for the
device control. Focus on implementation and tests for communication
interfaces such as RS232, Modbus and Ethernet to connect actuators
and sensors within the system.
