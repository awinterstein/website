For a start-up that is contributing to the smart city, a digital beacon
with automated, extremely precise GPS tracking and visualisation in
the cloud was developed. The goal: municipalities, cities, roadworks
operators and drivers save time and money through the management
of energy, operating state and errors. Eliminating the need for manual
inspection journeys. An interdisciplinary team of electronics, firmware
and cloud developers designed and built the solution.

## Responsibilities
Coaching the software lead, concept and implementation of the test environment and firmware development with focus
on the area of positioning and application logic.
