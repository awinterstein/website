An architecture review was requested for the control software, since the expandability for additional use cases seemed to not be given. In addition, the effort of a change from Qt4 to Qt5 had to be estimated.

## Responsibilities
Implementation of the architecture review, analysis of the results and development of concrete suggestions for improvement.
