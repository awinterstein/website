The customer wanted to test the motor control unit, that is used to
position the mirrors of a lithography machine. Hence, they needed
a software for automated and manual execution of tests for their
hardware test stand. This software should offer extensive analysis
possibilities and was based on Python and Qt.

Development of the UI component for the test system
with PyQt and enabling colleagues to continue this development.
