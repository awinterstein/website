A diagnostic tool developed by Zühlke, which enables technicians to
analyse and control the customer’s inverters using a PC or Android
device, was expanded to include additional functionalities. By, among
other things, an oscilloscope view that processes the analogue values
of the inverter and a recording and playback function that enables
the recording and playback of diagnostic data.

## Responsibilities
Implementation of additional functionalities within
the existing Qt/QML application. Consulting the customer on software
design, especially on the separation of presentation and business logic.
