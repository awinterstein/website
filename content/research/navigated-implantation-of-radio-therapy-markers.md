In the context of cancer research, a computer-assisted system should enable the precise and simple implantation of radiation therapy markers. It was intended to be used during an open intervention with ultrasound imaging.

## Responsibilities
Analysis of the workflow together with the domain experts. Implementation of the navigation application and evaluation of this through a phantom study in cooperation with the medical staff.
