After completing my master's degree in computer science at Darmstadt University of Applied Sciences, I worked for the innovation service provider [ZÃ¼hlke Engineering](https://www.zuehlke.com) for almost 9 years and successfully completed over 10 client projects, mainly in the field of embedded software.

Since 2023, I have continued my project work on a freelance basis and have already successfully completed the first project for [Hekatron Brandschutz](https://www.hekatron-brandschutz.de).
