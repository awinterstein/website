A system for automated tests was to be developed for an industrial oven on the market with more than 20 different derivatives. In order to be able to reproduce errors reported from the field more quickly on the one hand, and to replace the previously manually performed system tests with automated hardware-in-the-loop tests (HIL) on the other. In addition, a compatible software-in-the-loop solution (SIL) was developed, with which the control unit of the oven could be tested in isolation.

## Responsibilities
Design and implementation of the SIL test system. Implementation of the software for the HIL test system.
