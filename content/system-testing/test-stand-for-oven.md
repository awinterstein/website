In order to be able to reproduce errors reported from the field more quickly on the one hand, and to replace the previously manually performed system tests with automated hardware-in-the-loop tests (HIL) on the other. In addition, a compatible software-in-the-loop solution (SIL) was developed, with which the control unit of the oven could be tested in isolation.

## Responsibilities
Design and implementation of the SIL test system. Implementation of the software for the HIL test system.
