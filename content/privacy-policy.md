The following information provides a simple overview of what happens to your personal data when you visit this website.

## Responsible Body

The controller responsible for data processing on this website is:

Adrian Winterstein\
Niederwiesenstraße 6\
64331 Weiterstadt\
Germany

Phone: [+49 6150 1833121](tel:+4961501833121)\

## Hosting

The content of this website is hosted by ALL-INKL.COM - Neue Medien Münnich, Inh. René Münnich, Hauptstraße 68, 02742 Friedersdorf (hereinafter All-Inkl). Details can be found in the [privacy policy of All-Inkl](https://all-inkl.com/datenschutzinformationen/).
The use of All-Inkl is based on Art. 6(1f) GDPR. I have a legitimate interest in the most reliable presentation of my website.

I have concluded a data processing agreement (DPA) for the use of the above-mentioned service. This is a contract prescribed by data protection law, which guarantees that it processes the personal data of my website visitors only in accordance with my instructions and in compliance with the GDPR.

## Data Collection on this Website

If you contact me by e-mail, telephone or fax, your request, including all resulting personal data (name, request) will be stored and processed by us for the purpose of processing your request. I will not pass on this data without your consent.

This data is processed on the basis of Art. 6(1b) GDPR if your request is related to the performance of a contract or is necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the processing is based on my legitimate interest in the effective processing of the inquiries addressed to me (Art. 6(1f) GDPR) or on your consent (Art. 6(1a) GDPR) if this has been requested; consent can be revoked at any time.

The data you send to me via contact requests will remain with me until you ask me to delete it, revoke your consent to storage or the purpose for data storage no longer applies (e.g. after your request has been processed). Mandatory statutory provisions - in particular statutory retention periods - remain unaffected.

## Analysis Tools

This website uses the open source web analysis service Matomo.
With the help of Matomo, I am able to collect and analyze data about the use of my website by the visitors. This allows me to find out, among other things, when which pages were accessed and from which region. I also collect various log files (e.g. IP address, referrer, browser and operating system used) and can measure whether my website visitors perform certain actions (e.g. clicks).

This analysis tool is used on the basis of Art. 6(1f) GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in analyzing user behavior in order to optimize its website.

### IP Anonymization

I use IP anonymization for the analysis with Matomo. This means that your IP address is shortened before the analysis so that it can no longer be attributed to you.

### Cookieless Analysis

I have configured Matomo so that it does not store any cookies in your browser.

### Hosting of Analysis Tools

Just like the website, Matomo is hosted by All-Inkl (see also section [Hosting](#hosting)), so that all analysis data remains with me and is not passed on.
