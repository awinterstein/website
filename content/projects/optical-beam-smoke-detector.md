In an interdisciplinary team of firmware, electronics and mechanics developers, physicists and test engineers, we developed the smoke detector with a **focus on very high sensitivity in all operation conditions**.

The firmware was developed for an *Arm Cortex M4* controller in *C++* with *FreeRTOS* as the real-time operating system. Especially the measurement part of the firmware had to fulfill **real-time requirements**. The smoke level calculation had to apply various compensations to the measured signal, to account for signal variations due to the large supported temperature range or the increasing device soiling during the detector lifetime.
